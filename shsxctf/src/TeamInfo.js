        Gear is simple for cross country.  You need shorts,t-shirt, and running shoes.  Running shoes are most important.  The shoe you get depends on  what feels comfortable for you.  It must be classified as a running shoe.  You can go to any sporting goods store to find running shoes or fleet feet.  They do not have to be expensive  but they need to be running shoes.  I also have a few shoes available for use as needed.

        Summer training is important for cross country to make you the best possible runner. There  is a summer training program on google classroom at this LINK.  Bottom line is you need to get out there and run for 20 minutes to 40 minutes.  Also getting to a gym and working out, doing outdoor activities, doing core, doing anything that is not just being on electronic devices helps

        Typical practice for summer and school year can be similar.  You should do a warmup of  easy running,  drills, and a workout for day which could range from an easy run to a fast track workout. Practice always ends with a core workout and basic stretching. <a href="https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/dynamic-stretching-for-athletes.pdf">Stretches</a> <a href="http://www.rsgplus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/top_core_exercises.pdf">Core</a> <a href="https://jasonvaladao.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MYRTLE_ROUTINE.pdf">Strength</a>
